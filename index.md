Lime Text is a powerful and elegant text editor primarily developed in [Go](//golang.org/).

It aims to be a free and open-source software successor to [Sublime Text](//sublimetext.com/).

Lime has a few frontends (QML, command-line interface) that can be selectively used with the pluggable backend.

You can even develop your own and make it a drop-in replacement!
