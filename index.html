    <h3>What is Lime?</h3>
    <p>
        I love the <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com">Sublime Text</a> editor. <a href="https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeClang">I have</a> <a href="https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeJava">created</a> <a href="https://github.com/quarnster/CompleteSharp">several</a> <a href="https://github.com/quarnster/SublimeGDB">plugins</a> <a href="https://github.com/quarnster/ADBView">to make</a> it even better. One thing that scares me though is that it is not open sourced and the <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/nightly">pace of nightly releases</a> have recently been anything but nightly, even now that version 3 is out in Beta.
    </p>
    <p>
        There was a period of about 6 months after the Sublime Text 2 "stable" version was released where pretty much nothing at all was communicated to the users about what to expect in the future, nor was there much support offered in the forums. People including myself were wondering if the product was dead and I personally wondered what would happen to all the bugs, crashes and annoyances that still existed in ST2. This lack of communication is a dealbreaker to me and I decided that I will not spend any more money on that product because of it.

        As none of the other text editors I've tried come close to the love I had for Sublime Text, I decided I had to create my own.
