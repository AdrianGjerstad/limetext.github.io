We want to bring you a open source successor to Sublime Text. 

We use jekyll as a static site generator, since it's supported by github pages.  

If you want to help, bring change or contribute to this website, feel free to do so.  
  
Please know what you are doing!

Check out [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of the static site generator.

If you want to help, bring change or contribute to the project start [here][lime].  

And please, please know what you are doing!
